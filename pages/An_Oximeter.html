                            We want people to understand the mechanism of this device and how it actually works.
                           The tough times going on all around the world have brought special attention to the device shown in the picture above. You could have seen and even used this device to check the health status of your body.In case you don’t know about it, we call it Oximeter. The primary job of this device is to measure the Oxygen Saturation of your blood.
 When we inserted our fingertip inside it, the device calculated  oxygen saturation level and pulse rate. 
 Fine with the pulse rate measurement, but how could a device measure oxygen saturation level without even getting a blood sample? How could a device measure the level of oxygen in the blood without even entering the body?
You might have gone through the same thoughts after seeing the device work and measure your oxygen saturation level. Today, we’ll discuss the interesting mechanism of the Oximeter and how it measures the level of oxygen. That too by staying outside the body.

Before we get into the mechanism directly, you must have a basic knowledge of what the term oxygen saturation level means. Don’t worry, you don’t need to set off towards google…we are here to explain.

Oxygen is present in the blood in two forms:
1. Dissolved in the blood
2. Bound to Hemoglobin

In terms of binding to the oxygen and its transportation, Hemoglobin is classified into two types:
1. Functional Hemoglobin
2. Non-functional Hemoglobin
Functional Hemoglobin is further classified into two categories:
Oxyhemoglobin → Contains oxygen bound to it
Deoxyhemoglobin → Does not have oxygen bound to it
Non-functional Hemoglobin is further classified into two categories:
Carboxyhemoglobin → Hemoglobin that’s bound to CO (Carbon Monoxide)
Methemoglobin → Hemoglobin that’s bound to… not Meth, obviously! (Breaking Bad vibes at their peak).
This hemoglobin is bound to ferric ion  Fe+3 .
To measure the level of oxygen in your blood, we’re more interested in Oxyhemoglobin. This hemoglobin is bound to oxygen and transports it throughout the body. The amount of this oxygen in the blood is what we call Oxygen Saturation Level. Now that you’ve understood what this term actually means. Let’s move on to its measurement part.

To calculate the saturation level of oxygen, we need to know the amount of oxyhemoglobin present in your blood. That is where the Pulse Oximeter comes into play.

The Pulse Oximeter measures the percentage saturation of oxygen bound to Hemoglobin in arterial blood. This term is represented as  SpO2 .

                       Now, how is this number calculated?

This is where the engineering part comes in!



On the top of this device, there’s a display.
This display provides output values like the Oxygen Saturation Level (in terms of  SpO2 ) and the Pulse Rate.


Inside the Oximeter, we have two Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs) and a Photodiode.


One of these diodes emits Red Light waves (having a wavelength of 660 nm) and the other diode emits Infrared waves (having a wavelength of 940 nm).

The job of the Photodiode is to detect these electromagnetic waves emitted by the two LEDs. On detecting the amount of Red and Infrared light, respectively, the photodiode sends electrical signals for further calculations.

Now, how do these light waves help detecting the oxygen level in your body?

Let me explain…

You insert your finger in the Oximeter:

Your finger contains arteries inside it, which transport blood from the heart to the other parts of the body. The blood inside these arteries contains lots and lots of Hemoglobin.

                    <p id="paragraph">
                       To measure the oxygen saturation level, we need to find the amount of Oxyhemoglobin.

Since we can’t calculate the total Oxyhemoglobins present in your blood, we’ll have to somehow find the percentage of Oxyhemoglobin present in the mixture of Oxyhemoglobin and Deoxyhemoglobin in a specific amount of blood flowing in the arteries of your finger.

Take an  example here:

If the blood flowing through your arteries has 20 Hemoglobin molecules. Out of these, 15 molecules are of Oxyhemoglobin and the remaining 5 are Deoxyhemoglobin.

Then we can calculate oxygen saturation level as:

%SpO2=No. of Oxyhemoglobin/Total Hemoglobin×100 

⇒%SpO2=15/20×100 

⇒%SpO2=75% 

Hence, the number 75 will be displayed on your Oximeter.
                        
                    </p>
                   </div>
                   <div class="info-block-odd" id="info-block">
                    <p id="paragraph">
                       To find the amount of Oxyhemoglobin & Deoxyhemoglobin, the Light Emitting Diodes fire Red Light Waves and Infrared Light Waves, respectively, at a certain frequency.


Now that light waves are fired, we will determine the concentration of Oxyhemoglobin and Deoxyhemoglobin, since both of these molecules have different light absorption characteristics.

To be more specific:
Oxyhemoglobin → Absorbs more infrared light (940 nm) and lets more red light (660 nm) travel through the tissues of your fingertip
Deoxyhemoglobin → Absorbs more red light (660 nm) and lets more infrared light (940 nm) travel through the tissues of your fingertip

Depending on the amount of Red and Infrared light hitting on the surface of the Photodiode, further electrical signals are passed to the Integrator (where the calculations happen).

                <p id="paragraph">
                   To find the concentration of the respective Hemoglobin molecules from the absorbed light waves, the Integrator of the Oximeter uses Beer’s Law.

Naam sunke darr laga kya dont worry,The Beer’s Law is easier to Digest than a Beer.

According to Beer’s Law:

Absorbance  ∝  Concentration

In a layman’s language, the amount of light (emitted by one of the LEDs) absorbed by your fingertip is directly proportional to the concentration of the corresponding Hemoglobin molecules.

Using this law, the Oximeter calculates the concentration of Oxyhemoglobin (by measuring the amount of Infrared Light absorbed) and that of Deoxyhemoglobin (by measuring the amount of Red Light absorbed).

Now that we have the concentration of both, we can calculate the percentage of Oxyhemoglobin present in your blood.

%SpO2={conc of oxyhemoglobin/conc of oxyhemoglobin+Deoxyhemoglobin}*100

i.e.,  %SpO2={HbO2/HbO2+Hb}*100 

→ Oxygen Saturation Level

And that’s how a  little Pulse Oximeter calculates the saturation level of oxygen in your blood, by staying outside of your body and without even getting a blood sample.
